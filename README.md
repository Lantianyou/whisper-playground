Whisper is meant to be a Web UI for the OpenAI Whisper. whisper-playground provides a comfortable, easy-to-use GUI to help people who has little technology background leverage today's AI development in speech recognization.

**Use case**: transcribe recorded audio file to 10x productivities for legal professions && read a podcast

**Long term goal**: an annotation as fine-tune tool. Fine tune is such a high-level, AI scientist needed, GPU intensive task. But fine tuning is the only way to deploy AI. AGI is movie star, fine tuned one is your girl friend.

For example, I have 20 audios talking about the internal stuff of a company called FooBar. On the first transcription, I annotate the word "foo bar" as "FooBar". The rest of the 19 audios should remember that

## Problems and solutions

- Speech to text super expensive or embedded in other software.
    - xunfei, tencent, super expensive, convoluted expensive
    - we can be 100x cheaper and still profitable, if not more
    - meeting apps, you have to use the app in advance. Cannot import files, say mp3 files.

- Remove the pause and noise

- Label the speechers for speaker in conversation
    - The output file is a simple srt, only timestamp and text, no who is saying what, no line segmentation, weird file format, inconvinient for people not tech savvy

- Blank market
    - no 200 star repo for WebUI, in comparison, multiple ChatGPT UI for tens of thousands of stars

- Big market
    - Can be used in legal case, recorded audio is wildly used as legal evidence, but no judge or lawyer has time to listen
