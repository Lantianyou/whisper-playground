## Problems and solutions

- Speech to text super expensive or embedded in other software.
    - xunfei, tencent, super expensive, convoluted expensive
    - meeting apps, you have to use the app in advance. Cannot import files, say mp3 files.

- Remove the pause and noise

- Label the speechers for speaker in conversation
    - The output file is a simple srt, only timestamp and text, no who is saying what, no line segmentation, weird file format, inconvinient for people not tech savvy

- Blank market
    - no 200 star repo for WebUI, in comparison, multiple ChatGPT UI for tens of thousands of stars

- Big market
    - Can be used in legal case, recorded audio is wildly used as legal evidence, but no judge or lawyer has time to listen
